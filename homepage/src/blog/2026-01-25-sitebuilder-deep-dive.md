Our contributor Manuel Kießling has published a detailed introduction to SiteBuilder on his personal blog.

The article covers:

- **The motivation**: Why content changes often become engineering bottlenecks, and the limitations of traditional solutions like CMSes
- **How SiteBuilder works**: Chat-based editing, Git integration, and PR workflows
- **Key features**: Isolated workspaces, configurable environments, real-time preview, and cost transparency
- **Technical architecture**: Symfony 7.4, two-layer workspace isolation, and the vertical architecture approach

The post also includes a demo video showing a real editing session.
